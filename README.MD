# GITHUB EXAMPLE REPO

This was simply a project that was created to practice using the GitHub repository
and related desktop tools.  There are several things that should be learned from
this experience.

1. Getting used to pushing commits and pulling updates from the repository.
2. Learning how to branch and maybe even fork from the repository.
3. Getting familiar with the GitHub desktop client.
4. Randomly practicing markdown and other things for the fun of it.

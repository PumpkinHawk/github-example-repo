  <h1>Example GitHub Repo</h1>

  <p>
    This is an example file for the GitHub repository example.  We are currently doing simple updates to learn
    about basic functionality and practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is worth noting that there may be quite a few different commits and branches that do not really mean
    anything.  That's OK because we are learning!
